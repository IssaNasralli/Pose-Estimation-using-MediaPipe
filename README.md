# Pose-Estimation-using-MediaPipe
In this work we introduce a pose estimation application uses the MediaPipe library. The code demonstrates two use cases of pose estimation: one for static images and videos, and another for liv webcam input. In both cases, the code uses the Pose model then visualizes the keypoints on the input image or video using the OpenCV library, and calculates the frame rate of the output. 
# To test the application,
1- You must intall python  environement such as Anaconda
2- Open Anaconda Prompt and navigate to folder containing the pythone file (poseEstimation.py)
3-Line 27,38 and 40 of the code are responsible for setting the input of the application
4-Run this command python PoseEstimation.py
5-Press escape to close the inference window
# Some errors may occur due to dependencies, try to fix it.
